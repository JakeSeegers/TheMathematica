 * shadow pass cull what they cannot see while the draw calls stay few:
 *  - terrain: TileMap chunks of `terrainChunk` tiles, then per material merged back into
 *    batches of ≤ `terrainTriangles` over ≤ `terrainExtent` units (a material lighter than
 *    `terrainMinTriangles` in all: one batch) (TileMap.consolidateChunks);
 *  - static props (PropFactory.mergeStatic): per material ≤ `propTriangles`, and batches above
 *    `minTriangles` span ≤ `propExtent` units; trees — map, border and outer forest
 *    (Scenery.mergeTrees) — likewise with `treeTriangles` / `treeExtent`;
 *  - ground foliage: ≤ `foliageInstances` tufts per instanced mesh (GroundDetail);
 *  - shadows of the opaque props and terrain faces: shadow-only proxies merged across materials,
 *    ≤ `casterTriangles` over ≤ `casterExtent` units each (ShadowCasters) — the depth pass needs
 *    no materials, so it costs a few draw calls instead of one per material and region.
 * Every batch is culled by its world bounding box (SpatialSplit.cullByBox). The shadow frustum's
 * depth is limited to `shadowUp` / `shadowDown` units around its centre
 * (LightingSystem.setShadowDepthRange, set by the game), so casters far up-sun are culled too.
 * Measured trade-off (docs/contracts/LEVEL_EDITOR.md §5): finer pieces cut few more triangles but add draw
 * calls; these budgets keep a busy 128 × 128 village under ~300 calls with the shadow pass.
