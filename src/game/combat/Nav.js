/**
 * Nav — the enemies' walk grid and path search (KNOWN_ISSUES COMBAT-06 / COMBAT-18, COMBAT.md §7.6).
 *
 * Built once by `GlaiveCombat.load()` from the TileMap: a grid of 0.5 u cells (two per tile, so a
 * cell never straddles a tile edge) holding the ground height at each cell centre and whether an
 * enemy may walk there — a walkable tile or walk surface (a bridge deck), not open water, not within
 * 0.2 u of a static collider (villagers are `dynamic` and ignored), not within 0.3 u of the map edge
 * and not in a `blocked` area (the boss arenas grown by 0.5 u: only the boss and its adds walk
 * there, §7.6). Two neighbour cells connect when their heights differ by ≤ 0.55 u — tileMap.move's
 * step: one level up or down, a stair ramp; a 2-level cliff never connects — and a diagonal needs
 * both orthogonal cells open. Villagers, the player and other enemies are not in the grid: `seek`'s
 * detours and the separation handle them.
 *
 * A cell is **tight** when an enemy's body (tileMap.move's circle, r 0.3: every point of its rim
 * standable within one step of the centre) does not fit on the cell centre — the cells along a
 * cliff or a stair's side, whose centre is only 0.25 u from the edge. An enemy may still pass
 * through one (a narrow way), but paths avoid them where there is room and never cut a corner
 * through one (KNOWN_ISSUES COMBAT-18: a straight line up a stair's edge column ran the body into
 * the cliff beside it).
 *
 * `findPath` is a bounded A* (costs 10 / 14 per orthogonal / diagonal cell, +6 for entering a cell
 * next to a wall or a cliff, so a path keeps one cell off the edges where there is room, +20 more
 * for a tight cell) from a start to a goal, pruned at `maxCostU` units of path and `maxExpand`
 * expanded cells ("too far" counts as unreachable). The cell path is string-pulled with
 * `lineClear(…, body = true)` into at most `out.length / 2` waypoints, the last one the goal
 * itself. A start or goal inside a closed cell (an actor pressed against a rock) snaps to the
 * nearest open cell within 1.5 u on its level. Cost bound (COMBAT.md §18): GlaiveCombat allows 2
 * searches per combat sub-step, each at most `maxExpand` (6000) cells — about 1.5 ms warm for the
 * longest; `warm()` runs one throw-away search at load, so the first real ones are not JIT-cold.
 *
 * Every array is allocated here: a search allocates nothing. Deterministic: integer costs and a
 * binary heap with a fixed order. `beginStep(n)` / `spend()` ration the searches per combat
 * sub-step (a caller that is refused keeps its old path, or walks straight, and asks again).
 *
 * When colliders or walk surfaces come and go (the story's presence changes,
 * `GlaiveCombat.rebuildNav(rect)`), `buildRect` recomputes only the cells a change inside that
 * rect can reach — the grid ends identical to a full `build` (KNOWN_ISSUES STORY-04: a full build
 * on a big level took 14–42 ms, one hitch per change).
 *
 * The open cells are labelled by **part** (cells a path joins share one), on the first search
 * after a build: a search whose goal lies in another part than its start fails at once instead of
 * expanding everything it can reach (KNOWN_ISSUES STORY-14: 16–26 ms on a 128 × 128 level for a
 * story `walk` with no way). Four-neighbour steps make the same parts as the search's eight: a
 * diagonal step needs both orthogonal cells open and within a step of both ends. `buildSteps` is
 * `build` spread over steps (the story builds its own grid ahead, in idle time).

   *
   * - its height and **open** bit: the tile and the walk surfaces at its centre, the static
   *   colliders within `CLEAR` (0.2 u) of it, the map edge and `blocked` — so the cells whose centre

   * - its **wall** bit: its own and its 8 neighbours' open bits and heights, and its **tight** bit:
   *   the wall bit and the ground (`_standY`) on the body's rim, 0.3 u (`BODY`) from its centre — so
   *   those flags are recomputed one cell further out (the rim reaches no further than `CLEAR` + one
   *   cell either).
   *
   * Margin: heights and open bits 1 cell beyond the rect grown by `CLEAR`, flags 2 cells (1 u) —

   * 10 × 3 u bridge is 24 × 10 cells instead of the whole grid. The search state needs nothing:
   * `_seen` / `_closed` hold the generation of the search that wrote them and each search starts a
   * new one, so no search reads what an earlier one learned of the grid. A rect that is not one
   * (NaN, min > max) rebuilds everything; one beyond the map changes nothing. `blocked` must be the
