 * World built (`World.buildSteps({ paced: true })`) in slices of a few milliseconds while the
 * player still plays the level before it. The world stays outside the running game — no scene
 * object, light, emissive registration, emitter or collider of the level being played — until
 * the travel hands it to `Game.swapLevel`, which runs the steps not done yet (`finish`) and
 * attaches it where a build would have run.
 *
 * The travel takes it only while its inputs are the same: the same file text and the same
 * presence of every story-conditioned object (`presence`); anything else is disposed and the
 * level built at the travel as before.
 *
 * States: `loading` (the file is fetched) → `building` (parsed, the story applied, the world in
 * slices) → `ready`; `failed` (the file or a build step failed: the travel builds anew and meets
