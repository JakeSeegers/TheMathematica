/**
 * Conversations.
 *
 * Who stands where, what they look like and what the signs say is level data
 * (`public/levels/*.json`, see docs/contracts/LEVEL_EDITOR.md). This module holds the behaviour:
 *  - `CONVERSATIONS`: Emberfall's hand-written conversations, referenced by a level NPC's
 *    `script` id (ObjectCatalog.NPC_SCRIPTS), plus the combat `drillmaster` and `shopkeeper`
 *    (Cinderwatch Pass);
 *  - `levelConversation(obj)`: the conversation of any other NPC, built from its plain `dialogue`
 *    pages plus a built-in `action` (rest / shop / music);
 *  - `conversationFor(obj)`: picks one of the two.
 *
 * A conversation is `async (ctx, obj) => void` (obj: the level NPC object). ctx:
 *   say(lines, opts?)  → Promise<choiceIndex|undefined>  (opens the DialogBox as this NPC)
 *   toast(text), sfx(name), visits (times talked to before), game (the Game instance), npc
 * Markup: `{word}` is shown in gold.
 *
 * Languages (docs/specs/I18N.md §4, §4.8): everything this module shows is translated at display —
 * its own lines as `loc('dlg.<conversation>.<name>', 'English')` (a stable code key with the English
 * beside it: the `common` table's unit records that English, so an edited line shows its English
 * until a translator has reviewed it); the level's pages and choices by the text keys the villager's
 * object holds for them (§4.2: ContentKeys.js `dialogueKeyOf` / `choiceKeyOf` at the raw indices of
 * `dialogueUnits`; a page or a choice without one — the scripts' `{}` fallback, a level never
 * keyed — shows its English); the item
 * a villager sells as a term (`term`), the UI's default for none (`t('game.default.item')`); the
 * combat shop's wares by the labels `combat.shopOffers()` gives (UI strings). Sentences with values
 * are whole English templates with `${name}` slots, translated first and filled second
 * (`contentFormat`); lines that name keys are whole sentences per device. What `say` and `toast` get
 * is translated: the callers (Game, StoryRunner) show it as it is and translate only the speaker.
 * Names that are looked up stay English: the item a villager sells (`combat.buy` / `priceOf`,
 * `story.giveNamed`, the inventory — 'Crisp Apple' for none), the wares of the combat shop.
