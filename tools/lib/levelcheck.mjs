/**
 * The level checks of the generators, for any level: `tools/make-gildhaven.mjs` runs them on the
 * level it builds (strict, with its routes, street centre lines and scattered trees), and
 * `tools/check-level.mjs` runs them on a level file — an editor-made level gets the same checks.
 *
 *   gridFromLevel(level)       a `createGrid` grid filled from the level's rows (path tiles inferred
 *                              from the tile types: dirt paths, cobbles, stone tiles, decks, stairs)
 *   placerFromLevel(g, level)  a `createPlacer` placer holding the level's objects (colliders
 *                              reserved, bridges with their deck height resolved, waterfalls,
 *                              the object sightlines)
 *   checkLevel(level, { g, P }, options)   → { errors, warnings, info } (with the level's story
 *                              problems, `storyIssues`: scripts and conditions that do not parse …)
 *   addSightlines(P) · sightTargets(objects, doorOf) · cameraPitch(environment)
 *
 * Severity: the checks that find a broken level (an unreachable villager, door, sign or well; a
 * stair, waterfall or bridge that does not work; critters or objects off the map) are errors.
 * The composition rules of the level design guide (nothing hidden behind roofs or crowns, ≤ 3 % of
 * the path tiles behind roofs, flat footprints, no overlaps, no unreachable pockets, every point in
 * a region …) are warnings, or errors with `strict` — the generators' bar.
 *
 * Story states (docs/specs/CAMPAIGN_FORMAT.md §9): where the objects' `when` / `unless` apply (a
 * campaign's levels, a level with a story) the level is checked once per story state — each
 * distinct set of objects the conditions let be there (src/engine/level/StoryStates.js: the
 * combinations of independent groups of tests, all of them up to `defaultMaxStoryStates`, else a
 * sample) — and the findings are merged: one in every state where its objects are there reads as
 * without conditions; "reached only with `flag`: …" for what only some states reach (a warning);
 * other findings of some states name them in brackets; two objects never there together do not
 * overlap. From a sample, what no state checked reaches is a warning and states are not named. The
 * first state is checked in full, the others reuse its work where nothing that differs is near. A
 * level without conditions: the same report as before.
 *
 * Content-text keys (docs/specs/I18N.md §4.2, §4.10): every translatable text carries a key in the
 * data; `textKeyIssues` lists a text with no key (`missing`: it stays English in every language) and
 * a key on no text (`stray`) as warnings, or errors with `strict` — the generators' bar — and one
 * key on two texts of the level (`repeated`) as an error. An info line counts the keyed texts.
 *
 * Node-safe: no three.js (the game's rules that live in three.js modules — the bridge deck height,
 * the water surfaces — are mirrored here). Randomness: none (a sample of story states is seeded).
